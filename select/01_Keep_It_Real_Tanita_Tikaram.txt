Will you say those things?
That make me smile
Leave them rushing their morning
We're safe inside
'Cause you're close to me
And the world's outside
It's another dream

Where we can hear them calling
And you know what I need
And it's alright

'Cause you make me feel
Like I've never felt
And you keep it real
Though I'm someone else

When you hold me close
You make me feel
Like I've never felt
And you keep it real
When you hold me close

My baby
I'D never lead you on
I'D never hurt you or make you wonder
Am I the only one?

'Cause you make me feel
Like I've never known
What it is to be
Really lost in someone

It's the love that we make
Every waking day

'Cause you make me feel
Like I've never felt
And you keep it real
Though I'm someone else
When you hold me close
You make me feel

It's the love that we make
Every waking day
