Every week, oh no (Oh no!)
They were whistling a tune, they we were singing a tune
Every week, oh no (Oh no!)
They were whistling a tune, they we were singing a tune

When I...
So much...
Could have been...
Something like a soul

Time for you now to open up your eyes and realize
You ain't coming down, down from on the hill and down like a river
You don't know just what we've done
We can't give it away, we've been working much too hard

We wanna keep it real
We wanna keep it real
We wanna keep it real
Just like we used to feel
